Task 2
a)

No, there are squences that can be generated for this syntax that does not correspond to a valid program.
And example fo this would be:

A B in
    A = 2
    B = 5
    A = B

This is legal because you can assign any identifier to an identifier, but the program will not work.
Unification will not work as 5 and 4 are not the same value.


b)

Parsing is very relevant. A computer needs a very well predefined way of working.
We can write a thing in several different ways, and with only tokens we might fall into trouble.
There might be more than one way to interpret the task, and this will be problamatic.
The parsing is reading code, and outputting one unique output. This is how a machine works, and this is how we need it to work.
